Content Monetization Modeler

🏆 Project Overview:
This project predicts potential YouTube ad revenue using multiple regression models. By analyzing video performance metrics and contextual data, it helps content creators and media companies make data-driven decisions for content strategy, revenue forecasting, and ad campaign planning.

💡 Skills Learned:
Machine Learning: Regression models, predictive modeling, feature engineering
Data Processing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, outlier detection, categorical encoding
Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), regression metrics (R², RMSE, MAE), data visualization
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Streamlit
Domain Knowledge: Social media analytics, content monetization


📊 Problem Statement:
As video creators and media companies increasingly rely on platforms like YouTube for income, predicting potential ad revenue becomes essential for business planning and content strategy.

🗂 Dataset
Name: YouTube Monetization Modeler
Format: CSV (~122,000 rows)
Source: Synthetic (created for learning purposes)
Target Variable: ad_revenue_usd

Columns:

| Column                                   | Description                     |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| video_id                                 | Unique identifier for the video |
| date                                     | Upload or report date           |
| views, likes, comments                   | Performance metrics             |
| watch_time_minutes, video_length_minutes | Engagement and content length   |
| subscribers                              | Channel subscriber count        |
| category, device, country                | Contextual information          |
| ad_revenue_usd                           | Revenue generated (target)      |


🛠 Preprocessing Steps:

Handle ~5% missing values in key columns
Remove ~2% duplicated records
Encode categorical variables (category, device, country)
Normalize/scale features if necessary


🎯 Business Use Cases:

Content Strategy Optimization: Identify which content types yield the highest returns
Revenue Forecasting: Predict expected income from future video uploads
Creator Support Tools: Integrate insights into analytics platforms for YouTubers
Ad Campaign Planning: Forecast ROI for advertisers


🧩 Approach:

1.Understand the Dataset: Load and inspect the data
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify trends, correlations, and outliers
3.Preprocessing: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, encode categorical features
4.Feature Engineering: Create new metrics like engagement rate ((likes + comments)/views)
5.Model Building: Train and compare 5 regression models to predict ad_revenue_usd
6.Model Evaluation: Use R², RMSE, MAE to select the best model
7.Streamlit App Development: Build an interactive app for predictions and visualizations
8.Interpretation & Insights: Highlight key drivers of ad revenue
9.Documentation: Ensure code and findings are clearly documented

✅ Results

A trained and evaluated regression model to predict YouTube ad revenue
A cleaned, preprocessed dataset ready for further analysis
Insights on features driving ad revenue
A Streamlit app to interactively test predictions
